### \#4

Some software benefits from the structure of different paradigms and language syntax.
Other times, languages like C++ become incredibly convoluted with thousands of features.
When languages become too feature rich, it becomes hard to learn all of the features.
Because of this, readability can be hurt is one person uses a set a features that no one else knows.
It can also hamper compiler design that can implement the specifications.

As a result, many companies that use languages like C++ usually standardize which subsets of C++ to use.

The other part, Some platforms may require the safety provided by things like a runtime and garbage collection.
Some may need dynamically editable scripting to quickly solve and adapt to problems.
Others might need a high performance language that is built to work anywhere and to statically include all of its needed dependencies.
Or some may simply need a low footprint system that is intended to manipulate raw bytes.

No current language really offers a one stop solution to all these problem.

### \#8
